In this Repo, We will Discuss the <u>Design and Analysis of Algorithm</u>


<h1>Algorithm Design</h1>

The important aspects of algorithm design include creating an efficient algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way using minimum time and space.

To solve a problem, different approaches can be followed.
Some of them can be efficient with respect to time consumption, whereas other approaches may be memory efficient. 
However, one has to keep in mind that both time consumption and memory usage cannot be optimized simultaneously. 
If we require an algorithm to run in lesser time, we have to invest in more memory and if we require an algorithm to run with lesser memory, we need to have more time.

<h2>The main characteristics of algorithms are: </h2>
  
<ul>

<li>Algorithms must have a unique name</li>

<li>Algorithms should have explicitly defined set of inputs and outputs</li>

<li>Algorithms are well-ordered with unambiguous operations</li>

<li>Algorithms halt in a finite amount of time. Algorithms should not run for infinity, i.e., an algorithm must end at some point.</li>

</ul>

Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory, which provides theoretical estimation for the required resources of an algorithm to solve a specific computational problem. Most algorithms are designed to work with inputs of arbitrary length. Analysis of algorithms is the determination of the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.

Usually, the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps, known as time complexity, or volume of memory, known as space complexity.

<h2>The Need for Analysis</h2>

By considering an algorithm for a specific problem, we can begin to develop pattern recognition so that similar types of problems can be solved by the help of this algorithm.

Algorithms are often quite different from one another, though the objective of these algorithms are the same. 

For example, we know that a set of numbers can be sorted using different algorithms. Number of comparisons performed by one algorithm may vary with others for the same input. Hence, time complexity of those algorithms may differ. At the same time, we need to calculate the memory space required by each algorithm.

Analysis of algorithm is the process of analyzing the problem-solving capability of the algorithm in terms of the time and size required (the size of memory for storage while implementation). However, the main concern of analysis of algorithms is the required time or performance. 

Generally, we perform the following types of analysis −
<ol>
<li><i>Worst-case − The maximum number of steps taken on any instance of size a.</i></li>

<li>Best-case − The minimum number of steps taken on any instance of size a.</li>

<li>Average case − An average number of steps taken on any instance of size a.</li>

<li>Amortized − A sequence of operations applied to the input of size a averaged over time.</li>
</ol>
